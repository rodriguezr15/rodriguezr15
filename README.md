The goal of this course is to teach students the strategies for developing maintainable and efficient server-side Web applications. Topics include object-oriented methodology, server-side scripting languages, sessions, database integration with web applications, and web site security.
DB Browser for SQLite, GitHub, Lucid Chart, .Net 5.0, and Visual Studio Community, and D2L are all platforms and resources that will be used in this course.
Assignment categories that each student will partake in- Daily note quizzes, Midterm exam, Final exam, and Labs/Projects.
Failure to complete 2/3 of daily note quizzes will result in an “F” for the course.
Makeups will not be given for any assignment without legitimate reason.
Attendance and participation are required, including the use of the camera being on throughout the class.

• **Understanding GitHub and Github Classroom:**
GitHub is a version control system that can manage files and directories, track changes over time, recall previous versions of a project, and has a Source Control as a subset of version control system.
It is cross-platform, meaning you can access your projects on many different types of devices with varying OSs. Will allow for multiple users to access and modify a project at any one time without the need to be in the same location. Allows for working with partners across the country or the world.
Git Distributed Version Control can be used without internet, has no single failure point and devs can work indecently then share/merge work later.
Repos are used to organize a single project- can contain folders, images, videos, spreadsheets, and any other data construct.
